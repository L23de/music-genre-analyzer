Split
```{r}
# The data comes in sorted so we need to scramble the dataset to make effective and balanced splits
df = df[sample(1:nrow(df)),]

# Calculate how many rows to include in testing
split_prop = round(0.8 * nrow(df))

# Create train and test
train = df[1:(split_prop-1),]
test = df[split_prop:nrow(df),]
```

Save
```{r}
# Write to CSVs
write.csv(train, "./train.csv", row.names = TRUE)
write.csv(test, "./test.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```
