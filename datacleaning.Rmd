Load in CSV
```{r}
music <- read.csv("music_data.csv", header=TRUE)

# Remove the default 'X' column name for the song "index"
colnames(music)[1] <- ''
```

Remove Attributes
```{r}
music$artist_name <- NULL
music$track_name <- NULL
music$lyrics <- NULL
```

Normalize
```{r}
```

Split
```{r}
# The data comes in sorted so we need to scramble the dataset to make effective and balanced splits
music = music[sample(1:nrow(music)),]

# Calculate how many rows to include in testing
split_prop = round(0.8 * nrow(music))

# Create train and test
train = music[1:(split_prop-1),]
test = music[split_prop:nrow(music),]
```

Save
```{r}
# Write to CSVs
write.csv(train, "./train.csv", row.names = TRUE)
write.csv(test, "./test.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```
